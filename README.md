## Project Random Name Generator

Built a random name generator using an API called uinames

This is the endpoint to get the data https://uinames.com/api/?amount=500.

### This project works like this

1. The app fetches data first from the API. When the data has finished fetching the user can now generate a random name

2. The user needs to press the Spacebar key to generate a random name
