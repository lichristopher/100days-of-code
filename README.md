# Day 1

Made an Income-Expense tracker. For now I only implemented the add income functionality of the app.

# Day2

Learning Bootstrap 4 again using Colt Steele's course, The Bootstrap 4 bootcamp. Learned to use bootstrap colors, buttons, typography, jumbotrons,display utilities, borders, shadows, margin and padding

# Day 3

Learned how to make cards, and list group in bootstrap.

## Project Tip calculator

Finished the tip calculator. Learned how to get values from range input and number input.

## Project Random Name Generator

Built a random name generator using an API called uinames

This is the endpoint to get the data https://uinames.com/api/?amount=500.

### This project works like this

1. The app fetches data first from the API. When the data has finished fetching the user can now generate a random name

2. The user needs to press the Spacebar key to generate a random name

# Day 4

# Day 5

I coded along with Wes Bos's video about "Quick BMW Part Finder CodeAlong". Learned how to change
low quality images to high quality images. This only possible if there are high quality images or you know the path
of the images.

Built a temperature converter that convert
between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. When I put a value of any of the input box. It converts all the values to all scales

# Day 6

Built a shopping cart. Got a problem on how to tally the quantity of an item, but I was able to solved it. I used reduce to tally the quantity of a specific item. When I don't tally the items before I render. What happens is that if you add an item twice or more the cart will display two of the same item, so you have multiple items same items. So what I did is tally the quantity so the user won't see repeated items being shown on the cart and only see the quantity.

# Day 7

Made a simple book list using bootstrap then I implemented a filter function for the find the book title.
I use filter function to filter the search query
